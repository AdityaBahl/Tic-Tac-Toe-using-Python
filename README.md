# Tic Tac Toe Using Python

# Requirements

1. Basic knowledge of Python
2. Wanting to have fun while learning
3. Inquentiable thirst of making a BADASS tic tac toe gameðŸŽ® !!!

# Why Tic Tac Toe?

There are a few reasons why you might want to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python:

1. It's a classic programming exercise that can help you learn and practice Python concepts like variables, loops, and control structures.

2. It's a simple and fun project that can be completed in a short amount of time, making it a great way to get started with Python programming.

3. You can customize and extend the game to make it more interesting, such as by adding a GUI or allowing players to play against the computer.

4. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, so you can share your game with friends and family and get feedback on your work.

# Algorithm

The general outline of creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Define the game board as a list of strings. Each string in the list should represent a row on the Tic-Tac-Toe board. For example, the empty board could be represented as [" ", " ", " "] for a 3x3 board.

2. Define the winning combinations as a list of lists. Each inner list should contain the indices of the cells that make up a winning combination. For example, for a 3x3 board, the winning combinations could be [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]].

3. Write a function that takes in a board and a player symbol (either "X" or "O") and places the symbol on the board at the desired position.

4. Write a function that checks the board to see if either player has won the game. This function should return True if one of the winning combinations has been achieved, and False otherwise.

5. Write a function that plays the game. This function should handle player turns, check for winning conditions, and handle a tie game if the board is full but no player has won.

# Challenges

Very Awkward to play if you are alone ðŸ˜¢

# Conclusion

Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python is a great way to learn and practice Python programming concepts. The game can be implemented using a variety of techniques, such as defining the game board as a list of strings and using a list of lists to represent the winning combinations.
At last, making a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python can be a fun and rewarding project that helps you learn and practice important programming skills.
