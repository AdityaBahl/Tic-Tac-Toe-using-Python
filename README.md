# Tic Tac Toe Using Python

# Requirements

1. Basic knowledge of Python
2. Wanting to have fun while learning
3. Inquentiable thirst of making a BADASS tic tac toe gameðŸŽ® !!!

# Why Tic Tac Toe?

There are a few reasons why you might want to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python:

1. It's a classic programming exercise that can help you learn and practice Python concepts like variables, loops, and control structures.

2. It's a simple and fun project that can be completed in a short amount of time, making it a great way to get started with Python programming.

3. You can customize and extend the game to make it more interesting, such as by adding a GUI or allowing players to play against the computer.

4. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, so you can share your game with friends and family and get feedback on your work.

# Algorithm

The general outline of creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Define the game board as a list of strings. Each string in the list should represent a row on the Tic-Tac-Toe board. For example, the empty board could be represented as [" ", " ", " "] for a 3x3 board.

2. Define the winning combinations as a list of lists. Each inner list should contain the indices of the cells that make up a winning combination. For example, for a 3x3 board, the winning combinations could be [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]].

3. Write a function that takes in a board and a player symbol (either "X" or "O") and places the symbol on the board at the desired position.

4. Write a function that checks the board to see if either player has won the game. This function should return True if one of the winning combinations has been achieved, and False otherwise.

5. Write a function that plays the game. This function should handle player turns, check for winning conditions, and handle a tie game if the board is full but no player has won.

# Challenges and limitations of OpenCV

There are a few limitations to using OpenCV for face detection:

1. Performance depends on the quality of the classifier: The performance of the face detection
   function in OpenCV depends on the quality of the classifier used. If the classifier is not
   trained well or if it is not well-suited to the images it is being applied to, it may not perform
   as well. This can lead to false positives (detecting a face where there is none) or false
   negatives (failing to detect a face that is present).
2. Limited ability to customize the classifier: The face detection classifier included with OpenCV
   is pre-trained and cannot be easily customized. This means that you cannot easily adjust the
   classifier to better suit your specific needs or to improve its performance on a particular
   dataset.
3. May not work well on images with low resolution or poor lighting: Face detection algorithms
   can be sensitive to the resolution and quality of the input images. If the images are low
   resolution or have poor lighting, the classifier may not perform as well.
4. May not work well on faces with unusual or extreme appearance: Face detection algorithms
   are designed to detect "typical" faces, and they may not perform as well on faces with
   unusual or extreme appearance, such as very large or small faces, or faces with unusual
   facial features or expressions.
   Overall, while OpenCV is a powerful tool for face detection, it does have some limitations in terms of
   performance, customization, and robustness to variations in the input images. These limitations
   should be taken into consideration when using OpenCV for face detection.

# Conclusion

I learned many new techniques and enjoyed the process. There were a lot of problems, but
removing errors is what we must learn. The project may not give accurate results in some cases as
mentioned above, and there are quite a few correct solutions too, I will explore this domain further.
